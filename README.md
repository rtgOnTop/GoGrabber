üëª  **Story on this project** üëª

This is my first golang project, so please be wary of unclean code. Some of the code
was borrowed from others out of lazyness as of that, there might be some inconsistencies.
I didn't finish the getchrome thing so do as you will with that.
The main objective of writing this wasn't really to grab info but more of a learning 
experience for me. 


üë∫  **What it does** üë∫

It first scans its enviroment for sandboxes. Then, it tries to grab the host's, discord token, windows key, email, and IP

üìñ  **FYI**  üìñ

In the "main.go" file there is a getwebhook function
please insert your webhook into the getwebhook function


üìù **Notes from Author** üìù

I **Highly** discourage using this for malicous purposes, the malware is already burnt (
Not polymorphic), its **Illegal** to use this on others without their consent and 
full knowledge on what this code does. I am not responsible for damages if you use this
on others or yourself you using my code fully acknowledge this.
